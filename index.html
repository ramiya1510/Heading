Here we propose a method to detect the anomalies in video using a predicted model FRCN (Fast Region based Convolutional Network). The SSD (Single Short Deduction) is a training method that requires se

The MAP (mean average precision) was also accurate in SSD.There may be many objects in the walkway considered as anomalies in that the objects include people walking across the grass, bikers, skaters and trucks. The people walking across the grass are also considered to be an anomaly.  Whenever these objects come across the camera the network predict the class to which the object belongs and pass its class name to the neural network.
